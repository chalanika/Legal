                            We are implementing a platform that makes lawyers’ work easier and also allows their customers to connect with them in a more effective way.
                            Here, we categorize lawyers according to their specialty, so that, a customer can find an expert in the field through the portal. 
                            Since we have planned to have a rating system, a customer can connect with any of the Lawyers according to his or her will.
                            A Lawyer can market himself through this platform and it will help his career and reputation.
                            We use encryption methods like RSA file encryption, Dual key encryption binary Encryption to secure the files uploaded to the database and also when transferring files the  Encrypted files will be transferred between the client and the lawyer.
